** Description

The TMC2209 is an ultra-silent motor driver IC for two phase stepper motors with
both UART serial and step and direction interfaces.

* Stepper Motors

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:

A stepper motor, also known as step motor or stepping motor, is a brushless DC
electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. The
motor's position can be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without
any position sensor for feedback (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor
is correctly sized to the application in respect to torque and speed.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor][Wikipedia - Stepper Motor]]

* Stepper Motor Controllers and Drivers

Stepper motors need both a controller and a driver. These may be combined into a
single component or separated into multiple components that communicate with
each other, as is the case with the TMC2209 stepper motor driver. One controller
may be connected to more than one driver for coordinated multi-axis motion
control.

** Stepper Motor Controller

A stepper motor controller is responsible for the commanding either the motor
kinetics, the torque, or the motor kinematics, the position, speed, and
acceleration of one or more stepper motors.

** Stepper Motor Driver

A stepper motor driver is responsible for commanding the electrical current
through the motor coils as it changes with time to meet the requirements of the
stepper motor controller.

** TMC2209 Stepper Motor Driver

The TMC2209 is a stepper motor driver and it needs a stepper motor controller
communicating with it.

The TMC2209 can be used independently from a stepper motor controller, but it is
limited to simple velocity control mode only, with no direct position or
acceleration control. Crude position control can be performed in this simple
velocity control mode by commanding the driver to move the motor at a velocity,
then after a given amount of time commanding it to stop, but small delays in the
system will cause position errors. Plus without acceleration control, the
stepper motor may also slip when it attempts to jump to a new velocity value
causing more position errors. For some applications, these position errors may
not matter, making simple velocity control good enough to save the trouble and
expense of adding a separate stepper controller.

Most of this library's examples use the simple velocity control mode to test the
driver independently from a separate stepper motor controller, however in most
real world applications a separate motor controller is needed, along with the
TMC2209 and this library, for position and acceleration control.

*** Microcontroller Stepper Motor Controller

One controller option is to use just a single microcontroller, communicating
with the TMC2209 over both the UART serial interface and the step and direction
interface.

*** TMC429 and Microcontroller Stepper Motor Controller

Another controller option is to use both a microcontroller and a separate step
and direction controller, such as the TMC429.

* TMC2209 Communication

The TMC2209 driver has two interfaces to communicate with a stepper motor
controller, a UART serial interface and a step and direction interface.

The UART serial interface may be used for tuning and control options, for
diagnostics, and for simple velocity commands.

The step and direction interface may be used for real-time position, velocity,
and acceleration commands. The step and direction signals may be synchronized
with the step and direction signals to other TMC2209 chips for coordinated
multi-axis motion.

** UART Serial Interface

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter][Wikipedia - UART]]

The TMC2209 communicates over a UART serial port using a single wire interface,
allowing bi-directional operation for full control and diagnostics. It can be
driven by any standard microcontroller UART or even by bit banging in software.

The UART single wire interface allows control of the TMC2209 with any set of
microcontroller UART serial TX and RX pins. The single serial signal is
connected to both the TX pin and the RX pin, with a 1k resistor between the TX
pin and the RX pin to separate them.

The microcontroller serial port must be specified during the TMC2209 setup.

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <TMC2209.h>

// Instantiate TMC2209
TMC2209 stepper_driver;
HardwareSerial & serial_stream = Serial1;

void setup()
{
  stepper_driver.setup(serial_stream);
}

#+END_SRC

*** Arduino Serial

[[https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial][Arduino Serial Web Page]]

On some Arduino boards (e.g. Uno, Nano, Mini, and Mega) pins 0 and 1 are used
for communication with the computer on the serial port named "Serial". Pins 0
and 1 cannot be used on these boards to communicate with the TMC2209. Connecting
anything to these pins can interfere with that communication, including causing
failed uploads to the board.

Arduino boards with additional serial ports, such as "Serial1" and "Serial2",
can use those ports to communicate with the TMC2209.

*** Teeny Serial

[[https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_uart.html][Teensy Serial Web Page]]

The Teensy boards have 1 to 8 hardware serial ports (Serial1 - Serial8), which
may be used to connect to serial devices.

Unlike Arduino boards, the Teensy USB serial interface is not connected to pins
0 and 1, allowing pins 0 and 1 to be used to communicate with a TMC2209 using
"Serial1".

*** Serial Baud Rate

The serial baud rate is the speed of communication in bits per second of the
UART serial port connected to the TMC2209.

In theory, baud rates from 9600 Baud to 500000 Baud or even higher (when using an
external clock) may be used. No baud rate configuration on the chip is required,
as the TMC2209 automatically adapts to the baud rate. In practice, it was found
that the baud rate may range from 19200 to 500000 without errors.

The higher the baud rate the better, but microcontrollers have various UART
serial abilities and limitations which affects the maximum baud allowed. The
baud rate may be specified when setting up the stepper driver.

**** Arduino

The maximum serial baud rate on typical Arduino boards is 115200, so that is the
default, but other values as low as 19200 may be used.

[[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerialBegin][Arduino Serial Baud Rate Web Page]]

**** Teensy

Teensy UART baud rates can go higher than many typical Arduino boards, so 500k
is a good setting to use, but other values as low as 19200 may be used.

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <TMC2209.h>

// Instantiate TMC2209
TMC2209 stepper_driver;
HardwareSerial & serial_stream = Serial1;
const long SERIAL1_BAUD_RATE = 500000;

void setup()
{
  stepper_driver.setup(Serial1,SERIAL1_BAUD_RATE);
}

#+END_SRC

*** Serial Addresses

More than one TMC2209 may be connected to a single serial port, if each TMC2209
is assigned a unique serial address. The default serial address is
"SERIAL_ADDRESS_0". The serial address may be changed from "SERIAL_ADDRESS_0"
using the TMC2209 hardware input pins MS1 and MS2, to "SERIAL_ADDRESS_1",
"SERIAL_ADDRESS_2", or "SERIAL_ADDRESS_3".

The TMC2209 serial address must be specified during the TMC2209 setup, if it is
not equal to the default of "SERIAL_ADDRESS_0".

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC cpp

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <TMC2209.h>

// Instantiate the two TMC2209
TMC2209 stepper_driver_0;
const TMC2209::SerialAddress SERIAL_ADDRESS_0 = TMC2209::SERIAL_ADDRESS_0;
TMC2209 stepper_driver_1;
const TMC2209::SerialAddress SERIAL_ADDRESS_1 = TMC2209::SERIAL_ADDRESS_1;
const long SERIALX_BAUD_RATE = 115200;

void setup()
{
  // TMC2209::SERIAL_ADDRESS_0 is used by default if not specified
  stepper_driver_0.setup(Serial1,SERIALX_BAUD_RATE,SERIAL_ADDRESS_0);
  stepper_driver_1.setup(Serial1,SERIALX_BAUD_RATE,SERIAL_ADDRESS_1);
}

#+END_SRC

** Step and Direction Interface

*** Microcontroller Stepper Motor Controller

The step and direction signals may be output from a microcontroller, using one
output pin for the step signal and another output pin for the direction signal.

*** TMC429 and Microcontroller Stepper Motor Controller

The step and direction signals may be output from a dedicated step and direction
controller, such as the TMC429.

A library such as the Arduino TMC429 library may be used to control the step and
direction output signals.
